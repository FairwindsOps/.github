# Contributing

Contributions from the community are welcome on all Fairwinds projects.

Before contributing, please be sure to read over our Code of Conduct.

If you plan on making a non-trivial change to the project, we suggest
filing an issue ahead of time to let the maintainers know your plan -
they may have tips or ideas on how to best solve your problem.
